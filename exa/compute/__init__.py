This sub-package provides functionality for automatic compilation and
parallelization of functions and class methods. For high performance computing,
including parallel and distributed computing, functions need to operate with the
`GIL`_ removed. A natural method for releasing the GIL is through compilation
(see :mod:`~exa.compute.wrapper`). Because compilation (almost always)
requires statically typed arguments, this package provides a simple `multiple
dispatch`_ system for easy generation of function signatures for algorithms
dependent on specific input argument types.

Related to the issues of parallel and distributed computing are distributed
communication (see :mod:`~exa.compute.connects`) and resource management (see
:mod:`~exa.compute.resources`)

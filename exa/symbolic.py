Symbolic Data Structures
###########################
The :class:`~exa.symbolic.Symbolic` provides the foundation for supporting classes which have
both discrete and symbolic representations. It is often more convenient to work with analytical
functional forms when performing data analysis, postponing discretization until visualization
or complex computation is required.

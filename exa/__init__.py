This package creates a systematic infrastructure for an ecosystem of packages,
tailored to specific industry or academic displines, for organizing, processing,
analyzing, and visualizing data. It is built with minimal dependencies, leverages
established open-source packages, is itself extensible, and is targeted at both
industry and academic applications.

At a high level, data objects such as series or dataframes (i.e. `pandas`_
like objects) are organized into containers which track relationships between
these objects and provide methods for computation, conversion to other formats,
analysis, and visualization within the `Jupyter notebook`_ environment.

The purpose of this package is to provide a framework for reading data from disk,
organizing this data into related, systematic, and efficient data structures, and
attaching these data structures to a container to allow visualization and other
interactive exploration within the `Jupyter notebook`_. The following is a compact
summary.

- `editors`: Classes that facilitate creation of data containers
- `data`: Classes that facilitate data visualization via the container
- `containers`: Flexible device for processing, analyzing and visualizing data

Complete documentation is available on the web https://exa-analytics.github.io/exa/.
The following is a brief description of the source code structure, which may aid
in usage.

- :mod:`~exa.core.editor`: Generic editors
- :mod:`~exa.core.sections`: Section editors
- :mod:`~exa.core.parser`: Parsers

Note:
    Tests are always located in the ``tests`` directory of each package or
    sub-package.

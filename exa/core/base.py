Abstract Base Class for Core Objects
#######################################
This module provides a standard base class for all core objects. Core objects
are required to have an implementation of the :func:`~exa.core.base.Base.info`
method. Additionally, the base class accepts and stores all positional and
keyword arguments that reach its ``init`` method. Positional arguments are
stored in the ``_args`` keyword while keyword arguments are attached directly
to the class instance (by their name).

import six
from abc import abstractmethod, ABCMeta
from exa.typed import cta


class Base(six.with_metaclass(ABCMeta, object)):
    """
    Abstract base class for editors, data, and containers.

    The base class requires a concrete implementation of the ``info`` method,
    which is used to provide a summary of the object in question. The
    ``_getters`` attribute is used in concert with features to :mod:`~exa.typed`
    to enforce class attribute types and support lazy evaluation. Finally,
    enforces the ``meta`` attribute as a dictionary (for metadata name, value
    pairs).

    Attributes:
        _getters (tuple): Default prefixes for automatic (lazy) function evaluation
        meta (dict): Dictionary of metadata as name, value pairs

Composer Editors
####################################
Composers are editor like objects that are used to programmatically create
text files using a standard structure of template. This is akin to, for example,
JSON; the JSON library does not know a priori what data it will contain only
how to format whatever data it receives. Similarly, composers can be built
using a standard format or a template and have their data fields/values be
populated dynamically.

Introduction

The application program interface (API) is the syntax by which a user or developer
interacts with the code. The API is presented in order of dependencies and/or
requirements. Low level functionality (objects that make up the foundation of the
framework) are presented first. High level functionality is presented later. Users
may want to start with the :ref:`examples-label` page or get additional information 
interactively.

    help(exa)           # Package help
    help(exa.isotopes)  # Module help
    help(exa.Editor)    # Class help
    exa.Editor?         # In an IPython environment (including the notebook)

Visualization is accomplished with in the `Jupyter notebook`_ environment
using the `ipywidgets`_ machinery. Widgets are written in JavaScript and
follow the model, view, controller programming paradigm (see `backbone.js`_
which is leveraged by `ipywidgets`_). JavaScript features do not have the 
same interactivity as the Python API; they are used within the aforementioned
constraints of the `Jupyter notebook`_ `ipywidgets`_ framework. The JavaScript 
API is targeted toward developers; see also :ref:`extensions-label`.

.. note::

    JavaScript documentation is generated using `jsdoc`_ directly
    from the source code in js/src/ via the jsdoc to reStructuredText
    template available on the `web`_.

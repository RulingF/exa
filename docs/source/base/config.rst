Configuration, Logging, and Database Connectivity
###################################################
Exa requires the creation of a persistent directory, **~/.exa** (e.g.
C:\\Users\\[username]\\.exa, /home/[username]/.exa) that houses the
configuration, logs, content management database, and, by default, all data
and analytics notebooks (`Jupyter notebooks`_).

To take full advantage of the analytics and visualization features of this
framework, exa and its related packages should be run inside of a Jupyter
notebook. When using the workflow and other processing features, exa and its
related packages can be run inside of a notebook or in the console directly.
